		<h1>How To Prevent Phishing Before It Strikes</h1>
		<br><p>In recent years, scammers have increasingly turned to email and text messages as a way to target victims. By impersonating a trusted source, scammers can trick victims into revealing sensitive information like passwords, account numbers, or Social Security numbers. This information can then be used to gain access to important accounts or be sold<strong> to other criminals</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite the risk, many people still fall victim to these scams. That's why it's important to be aware of the different techniques scammers use and to know how to protect yourself. For additional information, please visit <a href="https://www.phishprotection.com/content/phishing-prevention/">this page</a>.</p>
<p>If you receive an unsolicited email or text message asking for personal information, don't respond. And if you're ever unsure about the authenticity of a message, contact the supposed sender <strong>directly</strong> to verify. By taking these precautions, you can help keep your information safe and avoid becoming a victim of fraud.</p>

<p>Scammers hone their strategies as new developments happen or trends evolve in phishing emails and text messages.</p>
<p>You might get an <strong>unexpected</strong> email or text message that appears to emanate from a business or group you are familiar with, such as your bank or a credit card company. It might originate with an online payment portal. The message may pertain specifically to your finances or your knowledge of the sender.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">They say they've seen some <strong>suspicious activity</strong> or log-in attempts they haven't claimed there's an issue with your account or your payment information there isn't say there is some personal and financial information you aren't familiar with it isn't authentic wants you to click on a link to make a payment but the link has malware.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1">There's no call for the government to forgive you to help you.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1">It's a scam to say you are eligible for a refund when it offers a coupon for free stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider what it would be like to be fooled by an email like this. Recipients of this message are generally deceived into thinking that it's genuine.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>If you have seen the email and it supposedly indicates a relationship with a business you know, but the style, layout, and content don&rsquo;t align with how the company normally operates, it's likely that the email is extortion.</em></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The greeting in the email is <strong>generic</strong>.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1">In the email, it states that your account is put on hold because of some billing issue.&nbsp;</li>
<br><li aria-level="1">The email invites you to click on a link so you can update your payment details.</li>
</ul>
<p>While real companies might correspond with you by email, legitimate companies won t email or text through a link to update your payment information. Phishing emails can generally cause problems for those who make fraudulent accounts or give scammers their information, resulting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft">identity theft</a>. And their reputation can be damaged whenever they <strong>spoof</strong> big-name businesses.</p>
