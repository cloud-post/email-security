<br><p>As technology continues to advance, companies are relying more and more on email communication for business operations. With this increased reliance on email, it's crucial to ensure that your email messages are delivered successfully and securely. One key factor in email delivery is creating and adding an SPF record to your DNS settings. An SPF record (Sender Policy Framework) is a type of DNS (Domain Name System) record that helps prevent email spoofing, a common tactic used by cybercriminals to send <strong>malicious emails and phishing scams</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Creating and adding an SPF record can seem daunting, but it's essential for businesses of all sizes to protect their email communications.</em> In this blog post, we'll provide you with essential tips for creating and adding an SPF record to your DNS settings. To discover more about SPF records, go to its <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/spf-records/spf-record-example">webpage</a>.</p>
<br><h2>A SPF Record?</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="spf-record-1.jpg" alt="spf-record" /></p><br>
<p>A SPF record or <strong>SPF TXT record</strong> is a record that identifies permitted senders for a domain that is similar to DMARC. SPF records list IP addresses that are allowed to send mail for your domain.</p>
<p>If an email recipient attempts to hand off a message to an email receiving server for mail acceptance, the web server performs a verification of whether the requester is from the email address on the receiver's list of approved senders.<em> If that is the case, the sender's domain is linked to the message's email address.</em></p>
<p>Your SPF record allows you to confirm who can send emails on your behalf. Your email correspondence is protected from spoofing and phishing attacks by simply letting the world know that you authorize certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web servers</a>.</p>
<br><h2>How Do You Add An SPF Record?</h2><br>
<p>To incorporate SPF information, you should access the <strong>DNS management interface</strong> for your domain's DNS. If you are using a web hosting company, the process is very straightforward, and they will supply you with the relevant documents. If you're uncertain, you might desire to reach out to your system administrator for support.</p>
<p>In order to create an SPF record, follow the procedure outlined:</p>
<p><em>Include all the contents of your list of domains, such as SPF records that refer to specific domains. </em>Make sure not to include nonexistent domains or inactive domains that don't send out email, as that has the potential to cause harm.</p>
<p>Now that you know the <a href="https://www.workplacetesting.com/definition/651/third-party-source">third-party sources</a> responsible for sending you emails from your domain, you will also have to identify them. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Email Servers (both web-based like Gmail, or via your ISP and in-office like Microsoft Exchange).</li>
<li aria-level="1">ESPs (email service providers that offer bulk email services) offer <strong>email marketing services</strong>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Miscellaneous support services (e.g., support systems for handling tickets, service providers for online payments, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="spf-record-2.jpg" alt="spf-record" /></p><br>
<p>v-spf1 ip4:40.113.200.201 ip6:2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348 include:third party domain.domain ~all</p>
<p>You can start with the SPF edition v spf1. This indicates that it is an SPF record. It will always start with v spf1, as other editions of the SPF mandate have been discontinued.</p>
<p>The SPF directive must be followed by every IP address that is allowed to send email as a result of your domain.</p>
<p>v-spf1 ip4:40.113.200.201 ip6:2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next is the statement's inclusion, which is a requirement of each <strong>third-party company</strong> that sends emails on your behalf.</p>
<p>v-spf1 ip4:40.113.200.201 ip6:2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348 include:third party domain.domain</p>
<p><em>Previous to the very same time, seek information from these third parties so as to discover which domain to employ as worth here.</em> Also, ESPs commonly publish SPF records for sending domains on your profile, be sure to verify with them as well.</p>
<p>At the end of your SPF record is the code all tag, which signifies what policy should be used and that by way of example if a sending server does not recognize a server (authorized) in your SPF record. The basic options for the all tag are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>-all= (fail) unauthorized emails will be blocked.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>~all= softfail denotes that non-authorised emails will be accepted but marked.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>+all= you recommend against using this tag, as it allows any server to send email from your domain.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, adding an SPF record is crucial for authenticating your email and <a href="https://www.vaadata.com/blog/phishing-how-to-prevent-email-spoofing/">preventing email spoofing</a> or phishing. With the essential tips discussed in this post, you can easily create and add an SPF record to your domain's <strong>DNS settings</strong>.
