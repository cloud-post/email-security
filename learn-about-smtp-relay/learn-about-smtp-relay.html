It is used to relay messages from one email server to another. <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/smtp-as-a-service/smtp-relay">SMTP relays are used to improve email deliverability</a> by providing a way to route emails through a third-party server. This can be useful for companies that have their own email server but want to improve their deliverability.</p>
<h2>What is an SMTP Server &amp; How Does It Work?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transport Protocol. An SMTP server is responsible for carrying outgoing email, and it does not accept incoming email. <strong>POP and IMAP</strong> are the protocols that allow you to retrieve email from a server, while SMTP is the protocol that allows you to send email from a server.</p>
<p>Currently, we see you regularly using an email delivery service, which must deliver the mail through SMTP. SMTP relay is a service that is commonly used to deliver transactional or marketing emails.</p>

<h2>When should I use an SMTP Relay Service?</h2>
<p>At some point or another, you may have emailed an SMTP server.</p>
<p>Many businesses and organizations send bulk email, marketing messages, and triggered person-to-person emails through SMTP.</p>
<p>Software programs probably use SMTP to deliver transactional messages, including password resets, order summaries, and other <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10091/">time-sensitive notifications</a>, including paycheck reminders.</p>

<h2>When should you frequently utilize the SMTP mail relay?&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">You can build a website or an app and then easily plug into an email delivery system, allowing you to send emails through that website or app using the <strong>email marketing service</strong>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">You are attempting to eliminate email complications, get your correspondence flowing again, and enhance your deliverability (your capacity for reaching your inbox).</li>
<li aria-level="1">You need an easy way to send email from hardware such as a copier, scanner, fax, or Internet of Things device.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Your email provider (Gmail) has a limit on how many SMTP relays it can do so daily, so a SMTP relay provider can help you to send more emails without being mislabeled as spam.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why is using an SMTP Relay Service important?</h2>
<p><em>Email is simple to deal with when comparing it to relaying common individual-to-person messages.</em></p>
<p>Even in the event that you do have an application that sends out time-critical alert emails that need to get into the inbox, tending to your own email becomes infinitely more complex as you send mass marketing emails to a large number of recipients.</p>
<p>Your choice of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/817-0204/6mg168c3t/index.html">mail host</a> can affect the deliverability of your email. If you reach your ISP's daily limit, your emails may not be successful.</p>
<p>Managed batch emails or automated email messages can be sent through SMTP relay services. By utilizing a<strong> reputable third party </strong>with SMTP relay services, you can guarantee that your messages won't be rejected due to delivery issues and that your correspondence will continue to flow to the inbox without issue.</p>
<p>In summary, an SMTP relay is a computer running a program that receives emails, translates them to SMTP format, and transmits them to their final destination. An SMTP relay may be part of an email server, or it might be a stand-alone server, separate from any email server.</p>
