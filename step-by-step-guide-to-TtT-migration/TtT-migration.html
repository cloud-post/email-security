    			<p>Migrating your business applications to the cloud can be a daunting yet necessary task. It is essential to understand the process of <strong>migrating data and applications to the cloud</strong> to ensure a smooth transition. In this blog post, we will be providing a step-by-step guide to migrating your business applications to the cloud using the Test-to-Test (TtT) Migration Method. <em>This method of migration is often used when transitioning from on-premise environments to a cloud environment.</em></p>
<p>This post will provide an in-depth look into the key steps that should be taken to ensure the successful migration of your business applications. By the end of this post, you will have a better understanding of the <strong>TtT migration method</strong> and the steps necessary for a successful migration.</p>
<p>When an organization opts to merge, acquire, or divest itself, critical organizational data like computing platforms, cloud accounts, email aliases, and domain names must be moved to another tenant. The in-built option to migrate data cannot be availed because of today's circumstances. An <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/office-365-tenant-to-tenant-migration/office-365-migration-services">Office 365 tenant to tenant migration</a> to the same domain will be useful in such conditions.</p>

<h2>How is Office 365 tenant to tenant migration achieved through the same domain?</h2>
<p>Office 365 tenant-to-tenant migration features two phases: the pre-migration, and the migration stage.</p>
<h3>The Pre-Migration Stage:</h3>
<p>The pre-migration stage can be subdivided into four substages, as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Making the website's domain:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Substantial storage space is imperative from the source tenant to ensure successful extract of data. Additional licenses might also be required.</li>
<li aria-level="1">It is necessary for tenants to begin admin accounts. This could be a challenging process to complete with special tools.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Dealing with users, <a href="https://www.seattleserver.com/clients/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/118/What-is-a-Resource-Mailbox-.html">resource mailboxes</a>, and distribution groups is also necessary when creating groups.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verifying the domain name:</strong></p>
<p>Following the prior step is verifying the target domain in Office 365.</p>
<p>In the Office 365 administrator's console, it requires adding a source domain in the target domain name in order to set up TXT records.</p>
<p>This domain should only be engaged with to test exactly for one focus customer. In case that isn't possible, the change will not occur. The process takes roughly 72 hours to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Scheduling for migration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Create a CSV file for mapping a user folder for migration.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The minimum value of TTL corresponding to the MX record of the primary email domain should be noted.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Directory syncing is prevented for the source tenant.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enable The Migration Facilitated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">MX records can be set to an untouchable value to prevent the flow of emails from the source tenant.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The primary mailbox of the source tenant should be cleared, so it can be accessed from the tenant-based inbox in an alternative deal with Office 365.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Prepare the target domain by checking the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-mailbox-migration">source tenant</a> in the target domain. It must be one hour after performing the above transactions.</li>
</ul>
<br><h2>Office 365 Tenant to Tenant Migration Tool in the migration process:</h2>
<p>Office 365 assistance tools for tenants can help you streamline tenant-to-tenant migration of data. It can help with the following.</p>
<h3>Transfer a Microsoft Office 365 subscription to a different tenant:</h3>

<p>Set up one tenant to another tenant's Office 365 subscription by following the steps listed below</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Purchase a private plan.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Remove the name of the existing Office 365 account's custom domain.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Create a custom domain in the new subscription plan.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Explicitly cancel the existing subscription.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Merge tenants of Office 365:</h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Install the Office 365 merger tool and log in to the system using the item's initial Office 365 account.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Add the alternative user.</li>
<li aria-level="1">By selecting the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSZJPZ_11.7.0/com.ibm.swg.im.iis.ft.usage.doc/topics/importcsvoptions.html">Import CSV option</a>, you can select a CSV file to import.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Pick the CSV file location for combining all accounts that have to be merged.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Users can choose to apply filters and grant the permissions they need.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Choose the Import CSV option and use the Date range option to set how long the data export will be performed.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Select the Export option in the <strong>Accounts to Merge section</strong> to merge accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, TtT migration is a complex process, but with a detailed plan and the right tools, it's possible to complete the migration with minimal disruption to your business. With careful preparation, you can ensure a smooth transition and enjoy the benefits of a cloud-native platform.
