		<h1>CEO Fraud: How To Avoid It And What To Do If You're Accused</h1>
		<p>CEO Fraud is a type of business email compromise (BEC) scam in which an attacker poses as a high-level executive in order to trick an employee into transferring money or sensitive company information. This scam is often carried out by email, although phone and other methods may be used as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phishprotection.com/products/ceo-fraud-protection/">CEO Fraud</a> can be difficult to detect, as attackers often do their homework to learn about their target company and its executives. They may even create fake websites and email addresses that appear to be legitimate in order to gain the trust of their victims. Once they have gained enough trust, they will ask for sensitive information or money to be transferred to an account they control.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals send emails impersonating the executives of an organization or other business and have them ask the employees, typically in human resources or accounting, to help them send out a wire transfer. Known as<strong> Business Email Compromise</strong> (BEC), this cybercrime uses a spoofed or compromised email account to deceive victims.</p>
<p>Email fraud is a form of social engineering where the attacker manages to gain the recipient's trust. Cybercriminals behind CEO fraud are aware that most people check email addresses superficially or will not notice minor variations in spelling.</p>

<h2>How Does CEO Fraud Happen?</h2>
<p>Hackers make use of four main approaches to commit CEO fraud:</p>
<ol>

<h3>1. Phishing</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cybercriminals make use of specific fraudulent emails and websites to steal cash, illegally obtained credit or bank information, or other sensitive information. Hackers employ a multitude of dishonest emails, as well as fake websites, to trick their target organization into sending their business documentation or bank information. Depending on the scammer's method, the criminal might then make use of malware or another method to <strong>gain access to the CEO's email, </strong>contact list, or confidential information that can then be used to send targeted CEO fraud emails to unsuspecting recipients.</p>
<ol>

<h3>2. Spear Phishing</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Spear phishing attacks use targeted emails to attack businesses and individuals. Before sending a spear phishing email, cybercriminals use the Internet to gather data about their targets that are used in the spear phishing email. A recipient trusts an email sender and requests the correspondence because of its relationship with a business or the mention of an event they attended. The email is then used to commit further <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/cybercrime">cybercrimes</a>, such as CEO fraud.</p>
<ol>

<h3>3. Social Engineering</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Social engineering relies heavily on the human emotion of trust to deceive people into giving up confidential information. By carefully crafted emails, text messages, or telephone calls, the cybercriminal seduces the victim into divulging personal information, for instance, sending money. <em>Social engineering is only effective when one's demand is known.</em></p>
<ol>

<h3>4. Executive Whaling</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Executives using this method engage in clones of executives to <strong>steal personal information</strong> and money from victims and believe they're doing something good for their organizations. Victims usually feel they are doing something good by assisting the company's CEO and professionals by paying a third-party company or uploading their tax forms to a private server.</p>
