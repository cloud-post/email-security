    			<p>DKIM signatures are becoming increasingly important for businesses looking to secure and protect their email systems. DKIM provides a way to verify that an email message comes from a trusted source and has not been changed in transit. They are an essential part of the email authentication process and provide an additional layer of security to your mail server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will provide you with all the information you need to understand and implement DKIM signatures for your email system. We will explain what DKIM is, how it works, and how it can help protect your emails from spoofing and phishing attacks. To find out more about custom DKIM <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/resources/dkim-selector">visit a website</a>.</p>
<br><h2>What Is DKIM?</h2><br>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="dkim-signatures-1.jpg" alt="dkim-signatures" /></p><br>
<p>Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM, or Domainkeys Identified Mail) is an email authentication tool that allows the receiver to verify that an email really was sent by its owner. This is done by generating an <strong>electronic signature</strong> for this email. The DKIM signature is appended to a message and secured with encryption.</p>
<p>A sender will need to choose which parts of the email should be in a <strong>DKIM signature</strong> before setting it up. He will typically add the message's body and a default set of headers to this signature. This approach cannot be modified. Once the signature is set, the sender is stuck with the selections that were made.</p>
<p><em>A unique textual string will be generated for the DKIM signature, the hash value. Before mailing the email, the hash is encrypted with a private key, the DKIM signature. </em>Only the sender has access to this <a href="https://koolspan.com/private-key-encryption/">private encryption key</a>. When the email is signed, the hash value is encrypted into the email, and the DKIM signature is included in the encrypted version of the email.</p>
<br><h2>How Does A DKIM Signature Work?</h2><br>
<p><em>Like email authentication methods, DKIM makes it possible for mail senders to attach precisely defined domains with their messages.</em> Records published in the DNS vouch for the authenticity and <strong>integrity of an email</strong>. However, DKIM does something unique to this method with an encrypted digital signature.</p>
<p>The DNS record is the primary identifier with a public key and a private one for DomainKeys Identified Mail, also called DKIM. The private key that is linked to this record is the encrypted <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/digital-signature">digital signature</a> of the author.</p>
<p>A DKIM signature let's mail transfer agents (MTAs) know where to forward information, in particular public keys. That is used to verify the identity of the sender. If the two keys match, <strong>mail platform providers</strong> are more likely to deliver it to the inbox. If there is no match, or there is no DKIM signature at all, the email is more likely to be rejected or filtered to the spam folder.</p>
<p>DKIM does not filter outgoing messages by itself. However, it helps determine whether a server should filter messages before they reach it. DKIM verification frequently leads to decreased junk scores for an email.</p>

<h2>Set Up A Custom DKIM Signature</h2><br>
<p>You can configure the customized DKIM signature to reflect the domain(s) of your choice. Here's how.</p>
<ul>

<li aria-level="1">Go to the Admin section.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Click Email, then the DKIM tab, and then click Add Domain.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Enter the domain you'll be using in correspondences as the From Address and click Add.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Send the Host Record and <strong>TXT Value to your IT</strong>. Ask them to create the record for you and make sure it sends to all nameservers associated with the form domain. To designate all nameservers as being responsible for the domain's DKIM key, the DKIM key must be propagated to all nameservers.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Once they have confirmed the record has been successfully created, they will choose the domain, then click Check DNS.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This will increase your <strong>email deliverability</strong>. You should get confirmation that the record is there and correct.</p>
<p>In summary, DKIM signatures can be a powerful tool for <strong>protecting your emails</strong> from malicious actors. They ensure that messages sent from your domain are authentic, and they provide an additional <a href="https://blog.totalprosource.com/what-is-layered-security-how-does-it-defend-your-network">layer of security</a> against spoofing and other malicious activities. With the right configuration, DKIM signatures can help to ensure that your emails are delivered safely and securely to their intended recipients.</p>
