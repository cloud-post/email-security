                          <br><p>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication protocol for authenticating email. It allows the owners of a domain to publish information that receiving mail servers can check to determine when an email may be forged. <em>But performing an SPF check is only helpful when a domain's SPF record is valid.</em></p>
<p>If the SPF record is valid, it means that the owner of the domain has published the right information for mail servers to check e-mails. This helps to <strong>prevent forged emails</strong> from being sent from that domain.</p>
<p>At DMARC Analyzer, we offer an <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/spf-validator">SPF validator</a> tool. Just enter your domain name into the SPF validator to receive an immediate report that shows your DNS record and looks for any problems. The SPF validator can also pre-validate and update before it is applied to a record to prevent post-update issues. We <strong>strongly recommend testing</strong> potential updates with an SPF validator before applying updates to the DNS record.</p>

<h2>Improve SPF Success With DMARC</h2><br>
<p>SPF email authentication is designed to <strong>stop illegitimate email</strong> from getting into your inbox by allowing domain owners to publish a list of authorized mail servers. This information appears as an SPF record, which is a line of text within the DNS record. When a receiving mail server gets an email, it performs an SPF test by comparing the IP address of the email to the addresses listed in the SPF record. If the addresses don't match, the email fails authentication and can be blocked or quarantined.</p>
<p>One downside to using SPF is that it's not foolproof. It can be broken if an email is forwarded, and it can't detect email where attackers have only spoofed the "from" address that recipients see at the top of the message. In order to be effective, SPF records <strong>must be kept up-to-date</strong> with accurate information about authorized mail servers. If this task isn't completed, SPF will no longer be effective.</p>
<p>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance) is an email authentication protocol that builds on SPF and DKIM, requiring that email pass either or both <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/README">authentication tests</a>. DMARC also requires that the "from" address is aligned with other address information in the email, and it instructs receiving mail servers on what to do with messages that don't authenticate.</p>
<p>While DMARC significantly <strong>improves the level of email security</strong>, it can be difficult to deploy and complicated to manage. <em>That's why so many organizations seeking to implement DMARC relies on a third-party provider for assistance.</em></p>
<br><h2>Simplify authentication with DMARC Analyzer</h2><br>
<p>DMARC Analyzer speeds up and eases the process of DMARC authentication implementation. Our <strong>software provides full visibility</strong> and oversight for all email channels, so you can safely put a DMARC reject policy in place. Emails from legitimate sources will never get blocked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With DMARC Analyzer, <a href="http://help.peoplehr.com/en/articles/965116-self-service-and-the-welcome-email">self-service email</a> intelligence makes implementing DMARC policy fast and straightforward. Most other DMARC solutions necessitate professional services for successful <strong>implementation and management</strong>, but our software is designed for easy and effective self-service.</p>
