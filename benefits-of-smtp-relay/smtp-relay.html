Proper administration of multiple <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-mx-record/">MX servers</a> helps reduce mistakes. Email marketing experts must not overlook MX service outages, but it's uncommon. When deliverables are at the peak, and there's an MX outage, experts are facing grave danger.</p>

<p>If a single SMTP service encounters difficulties when delivering to or serving Gmail or Yahoo addresses, utilizing another SMTP server is a clever way to rapidly fill the gap and keep all leads in the communication flow. With this, an SMTP mailing service can reduce errors and boost revenue.</p>
