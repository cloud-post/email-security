		<h1>Do You Know The Four Huge Benefits Of Working With A Value-Added Reseller?</h1>
		<p>Exploring the market for new point of sale (POS) technology can be stressful, and the way things function in retail doesn't stay the same for very long. It can be tempting to shop for inexpensive devices and do the leg work yourself, but spending more time and money researching systems can result in less time spent working in the store or restaurant, serving customers, or taking care of business.Instead of conducting the thorough process of evaluating a vendor and investigating components, a <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/resources/email-security-based-msp-partner-program">value-added reseller (VAR) can do the job for you</a>.</p>
<p>You should work with a certified value-added reseller if you want to manage your POS project.</p>
<h2>1. Value-added resellers are prepared and informed about best practices and procedures for POS implementation</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="value-added-reseller-02.jpg" alt="var" /></p>
<p>Oftentimes, you could invest days, weeks, or months researching POS systems, ensuring you're staying ahead of change, and preparing for updates and setups. But why should you spend that much time on the task when you've got a company to manage? When fresh technologies like mobile wallets or mobile POS come around or when conversions like the <strong>EMV switch occur</strong>, VARs are well ahead of the curve.</p>
<h2>2. VARs draw from years of experience</h2>
<p><em>A value-added reseller has implemented 1,000 models and has been exposed to all kinds of difficulties.</em> These experts have many years of industry experience behind them and have seen it all before.They are a great source of information regarding essential <a href="https://blog.bindy.com/5-pos-strategies-that-increase-sales/">POS strategies</a> that help you save money, what functions of your system and structure you shouldn't neglect, and where it's best to invest your budget.</p>
<p>Although it may be tempting to seek the lowest prices, beware when using online businesses to offer <strong>great bargains</strong>. Of course, they will give you a system for a bargain price, but what you gain is what you get. When you work with a bona fide business enterprise resource assistant (VAR), you're investing in a partner.</p>
<h2>3. They understand and are familiar with the latest in the industry</h2>
<p>It's easy to assume you need all the features and bells that some POS systems offer, but this is often enough. It is simple to try to find the most affordable option, but it might not be the most functional one. A value added reseller is invested in your success and can help you evaluate your needs and goals,<a href="https://teksetra.com/resources/choose-value-added-reseller/"> identify your budget</a>, and learn about the technologies your business needs over time. Partnering with a VAR means gaining someone experienced who has the know-how and credentials necessary in your business and industry.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="value-added-reseller-04.jpg" alt="var" /></p>
<h2>4. VARS are constantly striving to expand their knowledge base</h2>
<p><em>Selecting a VAR that is involved with an industry association means they'll be constantly attending conferences and meetings, participating in workshops and creating new connections. </em>As their priority is continuous industry education, VARs dispatch the most up-to-date learning about how they may help your business. You have plenty of knowledge to gain from their magnetic head, so choose a value-added reseller who's from an accepted organization and participate in group meetings.</p>
<p>They might be a trustworthy adviser rather than solely a brick-and-mortar <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/townsquare/what-pos-system">POS technology </a>vendor. A VAR is usually available to perform on-site visits and offers face-to-face support whenever required.Building a close partnership with the VAR will allow you to build a roadmap that can assist with your IT needs and the growth of your company. Give your business a competitive edge and do not just buy a POS system; work with a VAR.</p>
<p>In the end, VARs, or value-added resellers, are an increasingly popular way for companies to boost sales, profits, and project a better image. By partnering with VARs, companies can distribute their <strong>products or services,</strong> provide maintenance, and handle customer support. VARs act as middlemen, and by doing so, they increase their leverage in the relationship.</p>
