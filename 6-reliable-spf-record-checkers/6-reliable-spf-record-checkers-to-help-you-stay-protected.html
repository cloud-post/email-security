		<p>As a result of malicious actors' use of innovative techniques to infect and infiltrate networks and information systems, organizations mandate SPF record checkers for their domains for them to search existing SPF records, validate them, and highlight flaws, to be resolved as soon as possible. SPF records are crucial as they confirm the legitimacy of the emails received from their domain and assure their delivery.</p>
<p>Spam and hacking email attacks continue to increase on average. Phishing and spoofing emails represent one of the most popular cyber security threats today that can introduce malware into an organization's computer information system to inflict irreparable data loss. SPF record helps validate the email 's source by verifying the associated IP address against the sending domain owner's credentials. The <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/spf-record-check">SPF Record checker</a> searches, shows, and validates the SPF record while highlighting any violations, if any.</p>
<h2>What does an SPF record checker check?</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="spf-record-1.jpg" alt="spf-record" /></p>
<p>A record check provider makes sure a record is valid by checking various aspects that are considered critical. The most common among them are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The DNS is verified first, after which it takes note of what multiple records exist.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Only one SPF record is allowed in the DNS. Thus, it determines if there are any additional records.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1">The number of lookups possible is set to ten. Hence, it determines whether it exceeds the limit.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1">PTR is not recommended because it checks if a<strong> PTR mechanism</strong> is used and is not recommended.</li>
