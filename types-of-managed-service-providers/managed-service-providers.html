		<p>Managed services are an increasingly popular choice for many companies looking to streamline their operations and <strong>increase their efficiency</strong>. These services provide businesses with an outsourced team of professionals who are specialized in managing specific IT operations and services. With the help of managed service providers, <em>businesses can benefit from reduced costs, improved efficiency, and better security and scalability.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In this blog post, we will discuss the different types of managed service providers and provide examples of each.

<br><h2>MSP Types by Size and Responsibility</h2><br>
<br><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="managed-service-providers-1.jpg" alt="managed-service-providers" /></p><br>
<p>The differences in these MSP types are based on the portion of the real estate to be managed and the responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Pure-play MSPs.</strong> Service providers that are involved in monitoring and functioning of a certain service or application are <strong>considered pure-play MSPs</strong>. They provide a management service by reporting, mostly from a platform of accountability. From the consumer's point of view, they contribute to emergency issues. The consumer's IT department resolves these issues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>&nbsp;Staffing legacy MSPs</strong>. Their legacy MSPs take on a larger role of providing effective management and assistance for their customers. They manage multiple business technology needs by overseeing monitoring, reporting, <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/products/desktop-central/software-installation.html">software installation</a> and upgrades. They can be a great success when employees reach out.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>High-level MSPs.</strong> MSPS offers their clients the chance to outsource unique information technology infrastructures and procedures. They're not restricted to a specific area and <strong>offer a variety of options</strong> for various financial services, managed services, and full delivery. They can make sure that the operation of service(s) is uninterrupted at all times.</li>
</ul>
<br><h2>MSP Types by Managed Service</h2><br>
<p>Examples of managed services are application and infrastructure management to provide connectivity, network security, <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/virtualization">virtualization</a>, and disaster recovery. In addition, managed services may also include data backup and storage, mobility devices, handhelds, desktop computers, and technical assistance.</p>
<p>This section is a list of the different types of services that MSPs provide. <em>MSPs may offer a number of services, such as collection remastering and interactive conversations: .</em></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Networking and Infrastructure</strong>. Services include networking and communications infrastructure, managed hosting, and storage services. Environments include Managed Wide Area Networks (WANs), Local Area Networks (LANs), managed gateways, and automated network support.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>Security Services.</strong> These services include antivirus, malware protection, patch management, and security updates.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>Support Services</strong>. These services include help center, IT operations management. Diagnostics, and remediation.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>Data Analytics.</strong> These services include data acquisition and analysis, and AI/ML technologies to provide insights.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>Software-as-a-Service</strong>. SaaS is the <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/modern-day-equivalent">modern-day equivalent</a> of the traditional ASP model.</li>
<br><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="managed-service-providers-2.jpg" alt="managed-service-providers" /></p><br>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>Cloud Infrastructure</strong>. This service provides cloud-based computing, networks, operating systems, and storage.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>Communication and Collaboration</strong>. These services include data, video and voice services over the IP network. This is where you&rsquo;ll find managed contact center and unified communication and collaboration (UCCE) tools.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>Mobile Communications and Computing</strong>. These are integrated mobile software services that allow your entire team the ability to connect to the network from any location.</li>
</ul>
<br><h2>MSPs for MSPs</h2><br>
<p>MSPs in their early days were known for their hardware and software expertise. Over time, thanks to the growth of RMM, these value resellers were able to provide only basic day-to-day managed services. A company's capability to build its own RMM tools, NOCs and ITOM can be seen as a prohibitive task. Smaller MSPs are not set up for such challenges.</p>
<p>As a result, whereas an MSP serves a customer by helping them focus indirectly on their core business through outsourced IT services, we now have third parties that assist MSPs in outsourcing their core business through IT solutions. This has paved the way for a new sort of service: essentially an MSP for MSPs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, managed service providers offer a variety of services that can help organizations <strong>streamline their operations and maximize their productivity</strong>. Each type of MSP offers unique solutions and benefits, so it is important to understand the different types of MSPs, research their offerings, and select the one that best fits the needs of your organization. With the right MSP partner, businesses can enjoy improved efficiency and <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-cost-saving-definition-examples.html">cost savings</a> that will help them reach their goals.</p>
