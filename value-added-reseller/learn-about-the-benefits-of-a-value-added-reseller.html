                         <p>A value-added reseller (VAR) is a sales partner that works directly with one or more customers so they are empowered to sell a product or service. The main value proposition for VARs is that they get to sell products and solutions that may not have a full sales force, while taking advantage of the expertise of a third party they already know and trust (an existing vendor). VARs can enhance their enterprise clients' capabilities by offering technology or managed services that they may not be able to provide internally. <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/msp-partner-program">Value-added resellers</a> may add value to a product by assembling it, offering support services for the consumer, or putting their name on it as a label. These third-party partners form the pieces to manufacture the value-added reseller's product.</p>
<h2>What Is a Value-Added Reseller?</h2>
<p>A value-added reseller (VAR) is a business that creates an end product of end products. <strong>Original equipment manufacturers </strong>(OEMs) manufacture specific component parts for a subassembly, which a VAR will assemble into a product and brand and resell to the customer.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="var-1.jpg" alt="var" /></p>
<p>A VAR selling a product adds value by offering confidence, providing after-sales service (such as technical support), and sometimes even producing unique products themselves. For example, a VAR may buy auto parts from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer">OEM</a>, assemble the parts, and rebrand the final product to sell to the public.</p>
<p><em>VARs specializing in custom two versions are represented in the information technology and automotive industries.</em></p>
<h2>How Does Value-Added Reselling Work?</h2>
<p>Value-added reselling increases the cost-effectiveness of third-party products by including integrated products or professional services on the original equipment.</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>The VAR orders the OEM product.</strong> The OEM business relationship begins with the VAR it helps. The VAR (or customer) will order a product from the company which is everything from car parts to microchips to software. Sometimes, the product will contain the VAR 's branding, such as logos or other forms of brand insignia.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>The OEM manufactures the product.</strong> Next, the OEM builds the number of products that were ordered by the VAR in an industrial facility.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>The OEM sells their product to the VAR. </strong>Once the OEM completes the client's order, they deliver their products to the VAR. The VAR pays the OEM.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>The VAR assembles their OEM products to create a new product. </strong>The VAR assembles its own parts to create the product (the final version taken from different OEM parts). They add a brand name, and sell to the final consumer.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3 Potential Advantages of Value-Added Reselling</h2>
<p>Value-added reselling can have many positive effects, especially where IT products or other merchandise that require client support are concerned. Here are some of the advantages that value-added reselling has to offer.</p>
<ol>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="var-2.jpg" alt="var" /></p>
<li aria-level="1">VAR vendors can help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer">original equipment manufacturers</a> increase their sales by making their products more popular to consumers through a recognizable brand name.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1">A value-added reseller can address consumer concerns with a single point of contact for a <strong>hardware brand </strong>that is known for its exceptional support service. For example, the customer service department of a computer VAR will provide support for their exclusive products to consumers. Calling the OEM, however, may not result in assistance, as they are not used to interacting with them directly.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1">Value-added resellers are well-suited to help customers by providing technical expertise related to a full range of products comprising the whole IT setup. This makes it simple for the end-user.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3 Potential Disadvantages of Value-Added Reselling</h2>
<p>Value-added reselling is efficacious for selling such products as IT products or others that require user support. Here are some of the disadvantages of value-added reselling.</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">A value added reseller has limited influence on the selling price of the finished product. The likely cost of its parts directly determines the sale price of the finished product, with much less variation in price.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1">The value-added reseller has a minor ability to control the quality of the end product or package, particularly when it comes to software produced by an OEM company.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1">If a component of a VAR product breaks down, customers may have a substitute part, called <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-aftermarket-parts-2645922">aftermarket parts</a>. They are typically less expensive than the OEM replacement part.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, a value-added reseller (VAR) is a company hired by a vendor to provide additional products, services or solutions. VARs help businesses increase revenue, reduce cost, and reduce overall risk. These value-added resellers work with businesses to help them determine which products best meet their business needs.</p>
