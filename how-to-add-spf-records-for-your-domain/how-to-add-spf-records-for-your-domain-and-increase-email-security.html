                        <p class="tm-color-gray">
                         <p>SPF stands for "Sender Policy Framework," and it's a technical specification that's used to help security administrators monitor email traffic. SPF helps administrators identify which email servers are allowed to send emails from an IP address, and <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/spf-records">helps determine which servers are blocking emails</a> from that IP address. SPF records are created by domain registrars and are necessary for email authentication</p>
<h2>1. Collect the IP addresses</h2>
<p>Before you begin <a href="https://www.serviceobjects.com/blog/collecting-ip-addresses-on-your-web-form/">collecting IP addresses</a> used to send emails through your domain, you must be prepared to collect the list of IP addresses that were used to send emails on your behalf. This will likely contain mailing servers or individuals utilizing third-party mailing servers to send email messages for you. This list should cover all of your email accounts.</p>
<p>You can check some of the following IP addresses to include in the SPF: the IP addresses of your <strong>Internet Service Provider </strong>(ISP), an in-office mail server, or any web server hosting your domain. If you are using an ESP, contact your ESP to obtain your IP address.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="spf-records-email-security-1.jpg" alt="spf-records-email-security" /></p><h2>2. Compile A List Of Your Sending Domains</h2>
<p>It is possible that your company utilizes various domains in the course of business. You may send some of the official domain names as emails while you may not be allowed to send others.</p>
<p>Create SPF records that include both private and public IP addresses where you can send messages. This is to <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-spammer-registrations-plugin/">prevent spammers</a> from accessing the IP addresses that you don't use if they can t access the ones you use regularly.</p>
<p>Once you have discovered the IP addresses of the domains that will send your newsletters, live up to your definition of the SPF record by creating it.</p>
<h2>3. Create the Record</h2>
<p>You can create an archive in another SPF version based on the current SPF version. In this case, the current SPF version is stored in the archive in its initial version, so it's 1.</p>
<p>Whenever you've specified the version type, list the IP addresses you want to use as the address of your hosting service for sending emails on your behalf.</p>
<p>If there are any third parties that are used to facilitate your email campaign, add them to the list as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have successfully added the field tags and IP addresses, end the record with all or all tags. This tag is terribly important in the SPF record, as it<em> informs you how to communicate with a server that is not listed in the SPF record.</em> If your server sends a message through your DNS domain, the action determined by the relevant tag will be executed on the error coding server.</p>
<p><em>When setting up your SPF record, be aware that you can't exceed 255 characters</em>. However, if you must exceed that limit while adding IP addresses, use the include option. Then create an <strong>additional TXT or SPF record</strong> for additional. Create another block of 255 characters in the new record.</p>
<p>When you are finished with the SPF record creation, publish it to the DNS.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="spf-records-email-security-2.jpg" alt="spf-records-email-security" /></p><h2>4. Publish the SPF Record</h2>
<p>This means you can publish the report to the <strong>DNS, Microsoft Hotmail, Gmail</strong>, and many other email service providers.</p>
<p>To use your DNS server to change your page, follow these instructions.</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Visit your domain host provider&rsquo;s website and log in to your domain account.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Use the DNS management menu.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Select the domain containing the records you want to change.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Open the DNS Manager.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Check the text section and create a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-txt-record/">TXT record</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Write your domain name in the Host field.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Input your SPF record in the TXT Value field.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Specify the Time to Live (TTL). You may leave it at the default or enter 3600. The Time to Live refers to the lifespan of data stores in a network or a computer.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Click &ldquo;Add Record&rdquo; or &ldquo;Save&rdquo; to publish the record into your DNS.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5. Test the SPF Record</h2>
<p>When you are through with the record creation, test it. The test result will display a list of all the servers that are authorized to use your domain name to send emails. If there are no of the IP addresses on the list that you authorized for you to send out emails, update your record.</p>
<p>In conclusion, SPF records can be created using any DNS provider that supports TXT records and DNSSEC. SPF records can be applied to <strong>any domain, subdomain, or IP address</strong>. Services that support SPF records include Google's cloud DNS, Cloudflare, and DynDNS.</p>
