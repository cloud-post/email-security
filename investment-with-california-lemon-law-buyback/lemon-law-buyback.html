<p>The California Lemon Law Buyback is a consumer protection law that provides relief to consumers who <a href="https://www.askthelawyers.com/watch-video/does-lemon-law-apply-to-leased-cars">purchase or lease</a> a defective vehicle that cannot be repaired by the manufacturer or authorized dealer. Under this law, if a vehicle is determined to be a "lemon", the manufacturer is required to either replace the vehicle or refund the purchase price to the consumer.</p>
<p>The California Lemon Law Buyback applies to new and used vehicles that are still covered by the <strong>manufacturer's warranty</strong>. The vehicle must have a defect that substantially impairs its use, value, or safety, and the defect must not have been caused by the owner's abuse, neglect, or unauthorized modifications.</p>
<p><em>To qualify for a lemon law buyback in California, the consumer must give the manufacturer a reasonable number of opportunities to repair the defect</em>. In California, a reasonable number of repair attempts is generally considered to be four or more attempts for the same defect or a total of <strong>30 or more calendar days</strong> out of service for any number of defects.</p>
<p>If the manufacturer is unable to repair the defect after a <strong>reasonable number of attempts,</strong> the consumer may be entitled to a lemon law buyback. The manufacturer must either replace the vehicle with a comparable one or refund the purchase price, minus a deduction for any usage of the vehicle. The amount of the refund or replacement will depend on the specific circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the California Lemon Law Buyback provisions are complex, and the process can be time-consuming and require legal assistance.
