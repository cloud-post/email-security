		<h1>All You Need To Know About <br><br>DMARC Records</h1>
		<br><p>As email remains one of the most widely utilized forms of communication for businesses worldwide, keeping it secure is of paramount importance. With the <strong>rise of email spoofing</strong> and phishing attacks, email security has become even more critical in today's digital world. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance) is a crucial tool that ensures email security by authenticating and verifying email messages.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will delve deeper into DMARC records, what they are, how they work, and how they can help in protecting your email from spoofing and phishing.Being familiar with DMARC records and how they work can be a lifesaver for companies, as it helps increase the email deliverability rate, improve brand recognition, and build trust with customers. Visit <a href="https://dmarcreport.com/dmarc-record/">dmarcreport.com</a> if you want to know more about DMARC records.</p>

<br><h2>What Is A DMARC Record?</h2><br>
<p>A DMARC record is a text record in the DNS on your domain, under dmarc.yourdomain.com, where yourdomain.com is your <strong>backup domain or subdomain</strong>. It provides instructions for how to deal with email when a DMARC record fails authentication, and where to send reports about authentication statistics.</p>
<p>A DMARC record consists of a list of DMARC tags. Each tag is a pair of key/value separated by=. The table below shows what each tag possibly found in a DMARC record means:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>v: </strong>DMARC protocol version. The default is "DMARC1";</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>p:</strong> Apply this policy to emails that fail the DMARC check. This policy can be set to 'none', 'quarantine', or 'reject'. 'none' is used to collect DMARC reports and gain insight into the current email flows and their status;</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>rua:</strong> A list of URIs for <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/email-service-providers/">email service providers</a> to send aggregate reports to.&nbsp;</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>ruf</strong>: A list of URIs for ISPs to send forensic reports to. NOTE: this is not a list of email addresses. DMARC requires a list of URIs of the form 'mailto:test@example.org';</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>sp:</strong> <em>This policy should be applied to email from a subdomain of this domain that fail the DMARC check.</em> Using this tag domain owners can publish a 'wildcard' policy for all subdomains;</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>fo:</strong> Forensic options. Allowed values: '0' to generate reports if both DKIM and SPF fail, '1' to generate reports if either DKIM or SPF fails to produce a DMARC pass result, 'd' to generate report if DKIM has failed or 's' if SPF failed;</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>rf:</strong> The reporting format for <a href="https://www.salvationdata.com/work-tips/write-a-forensic-report/">forensic reports</a>.</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>pct: </strong>The percentage tag instructs ISPs to only apply the DMARC policy to a percentage of failing email's. 'pct = 50' will tell receivers to only apply the 'p = ' policy 50% of the time against emails that fail the DMARC check.&nbsp;</li>
<br><li aria-level="1"><strong>adkim: </strong>Specifies the 'Alignment Mode' for <strong>DKIM signatures</strong>, this can be either 'r' (Relaxed) or 's' (Strict). In Relaxed mode, authenticated DKIM signing domains (d=) that share an Organizational Domain with an email's From domain will pass the DMARC check. In Strict mode an exact match is required;</li>
</ul>
<br><h2>How Is A DMARC Record Used?</h2><br>
<br><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="dmarc-records-44.jpg" alt="dmarc-records" /></p><br>
<p>When an email message is sent from a domain that has a DMARC record, the recipient's email service provider can use the record to determine if the message is legitimate or if it should be rejected, quarantined, or <strong>marked as spam</strong>. The DMARC record contains several key pieces of information, including:</p>
<p>The policy for handling messages that fail authentication checks. This can be set to "none" (take no action), "quarantine" (deliver the message to the recipient's spam folder), or "reject" (don't deliver the message at all).</p>
<p><em>The email addresses to which DMARC reports should be sent. </em>These reports contain information about all email messages that were sent from the domain, including whether or not they passed DMARC authentication checks.</p>
<p>The<strong> authentication methods</strong> that should be used to verify incoming email messages, such as SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail).</p>
<p>In summary, the implementation of DMARC can greatly enhance email security by making it harder for <a href="https://www.kiuwan.com/blog/how-to-stop-malicious-actors-in-software-supply-chains/?">malicious actors</a> to spoof a sender's domain. DMARC allows domain owners to control how their domain is used for email and provides valuable information about email traffic statistics. Though the process of setting up a DMARC record can be daunting, free resources are available to help with this critical step toward strengthening email security.</p>
