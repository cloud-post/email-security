                          <br><p>As businesses move further and further into the digital age, the need for secure and reliable communication platforms has become increasingly important. This is especially true when it comes to email-based workflows and communication. DMARC, or Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance, is one of the best ways to ensure that the emails sent from and to your <a href="https://dmarcreport.com/setting-up-dmarc-office-365-and-how-to-protect-your-online-reputation-by-stopping-email-spoofing/">Office 365</a> organization are safe and secure. DMARC is an email authentication protocol that helps to protect domains from malicious emails, phishing scams, and other malicious attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DMARC, also known as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance, is a protocol for managing email to ensure that messages originate from genuine domains. DMARC is among the most effective ways to guard against phishing, domain impersonation and other <strong>email-based threats</strong>.</p>
<p><em>DMARC builds on the industry standard SPF and DKIM protocols for verifying email.</em> The community has set up a DMARC check to confirm that an email sent from an address was sent by the host server matching the "From" header. DMARC record instructs the recipient who has gotten an email what to do when authentication fails.</p>
<br><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="dmarc-01.jpg" alt="dmarc" /></p><br>
<p>DMARC is a crucial tool for businesses and organizations that use Microsoft Office 365. Outbound mail sent to an organization's own domain is handled with DMARC by default, however, DMARC must be monitored via a <a href="https://www.loc.gov/legal/third-party-websites-services-and-applications/">third-party site</a> if your organization uses a custom domain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's equally as demanding to configure DMARC in Office 365 and with any other email server. DMARC is built on top of SPF and DKIM, so email administrators must guarantee that their SPF and DKIM records are <strong>up-to-date and properly authorized</strong>.</p>
<p>Implementing and enforcing a DMARC policy before identifying all email senders using their domains can save administrators money as spammers cost companies billions of dollars each year. <em>Companies end up paying damages due to fraud for thousands of domains they do not enforce DMARC policies for.</em></p>
<p>Commercial organizations may approve DMARC policies only after weeks or months of careful deliberation. They may examine DMARC reports and then defer the DMARC reject policy for a few weeks or months.</p>
<p>There is currently no native tool to monitor or manage DMARC in Office 365. For organizations that wish to decrease deployment and provide scalable management of DMARC, an <strong>easy-to-use solution</strong> that integrates seamlessly with Office 365.</p>
