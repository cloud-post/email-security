		<h1>The Ultimate Guide To Understanding And Detecting Zero-Day Attacks</h1>
		<p>A zero-day exploit is a security vulnerability that is unknown to the software developer or vendor. This type of exploit can be used by attackers to gain access to a system or network before the developer has a chance to patch the security hole. <a href="https://www.phishprotection.com/content/zero-day-attacks/">Zero-day exploits </a>are often used in targeted attacks against high-value targets such as government agencies or large corporations.</p>
<h2>Defining Zero-Day Exploits, Vulnerabilities, and Attacks</h2>
<p>A flaw in computer code can potentially be exploited by hackers, which gives rise to a zero-day vulnerability when the people responsible for developing the code have little to no knowledge of the issue. If software developers and IT departments do not learn about an error before hackers are able to take advantage of it, the contract is said to have a zero-day vulnerability.</p>
<p>In some cases, a zero-day vulnerability was present as soon as the code was developed. Individuals who hack can locate the <strong>malfunction in the code</strong> and resultant vulnerability, even when the source code is unrecognized by developers, IT teams, and commercial users.</p>

<p><em>Hackers subsequently found a vulnerability in a zero-day exploit and began developing a hard-to-detect malware or virus. They then leveraged this vulnerability to launch an attack.</em></p>
<p>Zero-day vulnerabilities can give hackers a foothold into a computer system 's security and functionality. If they seize control of an infected software or system, pre existing malware can <a href="https://enterprise.comodo.com/malware-infection.php">infect the malware</a>, operating system, firmware, and or system memory, quickly compromising the information on the affected device, network, or other system.</p>
<h2>How Zero-Day Attacks Work</h2>
<p>Malware vendors typically build and sell exploit kits on the dark web. Other hackers pay for these kits so they can launch their own zero-day attacks,<strong> including lucrative ransomware,</strong> cryptojacking, or other advanced threats, increasing the number of attack threats.</p>
<p>Hackers may use a zero-day exploit kit or malware that is based on an existing vulnerability in the source code of an application, OS, or other software resource in a surprise cyber attack. In this scenario, the adware or malware may be a new item or be easily misinterpreted if it features no distinguishing features, and security solutions may not find and block it.</p>
<h2>Targets of Zero-Day Exploits</h2>
<p>SaaS vendors and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchitchannel/definition/managed-service-provider">managed service providers</a> (MSPs) are popular targets for zero-day exploits, because these organizations frequently distribute fixes directly to many organizations via software update services. One zero-day exploit that targets a SaaS or MSP has the potential to spread quickly.</p>
<p><em>One variation of a zero-moment attack is known as a software supply chain attack because it infects a piece of software, OS, or update prior to its distribution.</em> In a supply chain attack, the malware is positioned within legitimate code so the malicious signature and behavior are disguised.</p>
<p>These security threats are defined as fileless because they do not require a download or installation to the target system. Instead, the malicious code can <strong>hijack legitimate system tools </strong>and function in memory without being saved on the hard drive.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="zero-day-attack-44.jpg" alt="zero-day-attack" /></p>
<h2>Detecting Zero-Day Exploits</h2>
<p>With zero-day hacks, hackers can obtain access to an organization's networks through security vulnerabilities that are unknown to them, making them more difficult to spot. Anything that resembles a known infection, however, may simply be another zero-day attack.</p>
<p>Clues may be found in the behavior of the suspect code and the nature of its interactions with the target system. With the application of machine learning, a suspected pattern of behavior can sometimes be discovered and flagged for inspection.</p>
<p>Sometimes <a href="https://www.barracuda.com/glossary/zero-day-threat">zero-day threats </a>go unnoticed by IT personnel and become exposed by an ordinary user who notices the software program behaving in a suspicious fashion. In other instances, an observant or even lucky programmer may detect a zero-day vulnerability before the code is released, thus sabotaging an attack.</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>Zero Day exploits are vulnerabilities</strong> in software that has not been released yet. An exploit is a method of exploiting that vulnerability. There are many methods that can be used, but the most common technique is using code injection.</p>
