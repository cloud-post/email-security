		<p>The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email validation system designed to <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/spf-record-check">prevent spam by verifying that the sender</a> of an email is authorized to send messages from the domain in the email's "From" header.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SPF is a relatively new system, but it is already having a major impact on the fight against spam. According to a recent study, SPF has reduced the amount of spam in the inboxes of users who have SPF-enabled email accounts by an average of 70%. That's a huge reduction, and it's only going to get better as more and more email providers adopt SPF.</p>
<p>If you're not using SPF, you should be. It's an effective way to reduce spam</p>
<h2>SPF in detail</h2>

<p>SPF, also known as the Sender Policy Framework (email authentication), is an attempt to prevent spam and spoofing of email messages. SPF detects email spoofing by providing a way to authorize the identity of whoever is permitted to send emails from you.<em> SPF enhances message deliverability, improves domain credibility and reputation, and enhances user trust &amp; confidence.</em></p>
<p>E-mails contain two forms: header from address and envelope from address. The header from address is in the from: field of an email and is visible to all users. The envelope from address indicates which address to reply, or bounce, back to.</p>
<p>Some spam detection software examines the envelope from the address to ascertain whether it matches any URLs recognized to send spam. To avoid this kind of filtration, spammers sometimes use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing">fake envelope from the address</a>.</p>
<p>Email service providers make use of SPF checks to specify legitimate senders. The SPF check looks up the domain name listed in the envelope from the address and compares its SPF record to the IP address sending the email. If the SPF record contains the sending IP address, the message must <strong>pass</strong> SPF authentication. If not, the email can be flagged as spam.</p>
<h2>How to Create or Modify an SPF Record</h2>
<p>Setting up Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for your domain is simple but helps prevent email delivery issues from occurring. Beyond the basic requirement of having an SPF record for every single one of your sending domains and subaccounts (and subdomains) implementing SPF is a vital step in attaining DMARC compliance.</p>
<h2>SPF Set Up</h2>
<p>Slightly, you create an SPF record to reflect IP addresses that will be sending mail on behalf of your domain. If your business is using an SPF<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/"> DNS record</a>, it is accessible to the public. Once an email is sent claiming to be from your IP address, the recipient mail server checks your SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record and empowers the message to be sent by those who are permitted to act as your representative. If granted, the recipient will recognize that your email is legitimate, or from a trusted source, and decide to accept the message accordingly. If the recipient reads the email neither entirely nor fails to do so, they can increase their chance of blocking it, deleting it, or blocking it from future view. SPF is an <strong>effective weapon</strong> in the fight against email fraud (e.g., spoofing, phishing, spam).</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="spf-records-25.jpg" alt="spf-records" /></p>
<p>To implement SPF for your domain via your domain hosting provider, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Open your account</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>At the Domains drop-down menu, select your domain name (click &ldquo;Show All&rdquo; if your domain is not displayed)</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Under the DNS &amp; Zone Files menu, click &ldquo;Edit DNS Zone File&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Click &ldquo;+ Add Row&rdquo; to create a new record</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Set the type to TXT and enter your SPF record in the right column (substitute your server&rsquo;s IP address where needed)</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>v=spf1 a mx ip4:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -all</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Click &ldquo;Save&rdquo; to add changes</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Any domain your business sends emails from must have an SPF record in place. By doing so, your emails are shielded no matter what domain(s) you authorize to issue outbound messages. SPF records also need to incorporate all the IPs and third-party email providers that you send emails from. Again, covering all your bases makes sure that your emails and your clients receive the<strong> best protection</strong> from malicious activity.</p>
<p>To summarize, SPF is a set of standards designed to ensure that email messages are from a server or domain that the intended recipient trusts. SPF is often used in email authentication schemes. If SPF is configured correctly, then an <a href="https://www.mimecast.com/content/spf-check/#:~:text=An%20SPF%20record%20check%20is,DKIM%20records%20and%20DMARC%20records.">SPF check ensures</a> that email messages are not forged or misattributed to the wrong email server.</p>
