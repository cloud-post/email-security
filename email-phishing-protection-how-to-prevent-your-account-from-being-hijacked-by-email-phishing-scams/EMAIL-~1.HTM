    			<p>Email is one of the most widely used means of communicating for business, and phishing often comes through text messages and phone calls. A <a href="https://www.phishprotection.com">phishing email</a> is a fraudulent email message in which an impersonator tries to trick you into downloading malware, giving confidential information, or wiring money.</p>
<p>The standard phishing attack focuses on quantity, not quality. In these attempts, hackers launch an attack on many targets at once, with minimal personalization. It's rare for scammers to attempt a pure phishing attack, one that's intended for a group of victims without meticulous research.</p>
<h2>What to do if you responded to a phishing email</h2>
<p>CFOs and employees who receive sufficient training might recognize <a href="https://cofense.com/knowledge-center/how-to-spot-phishing/">suspicious emails</a> well. With that said, it's not uncommon for a slight slip up to take place, especially when responding to emails and on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Knowing what to do after a successful phishing attack will help you minimize the fallout. You'll want to abide by these steps if you recognize that you've been the victim of a phishing email.</p>

<h3>1. Change your account passwords.</h3>
<p>It's essential in general if you've experienced a login attack triggered by a <strong>fake login page</strong>. The email may have contained a link to an earlier page that was similar to your regular login page. Although it seemed legitimate at first glance, logging in on this page may have sent your account details to the attacker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, once the cybercriminals get your credentials, they will use it to enter previously identified accounts. We discourage you from using the same password for multiple accounts, but it can happen. If that's the case, you have to locate those accounts and change the password before they're compromised.</p>
<h3>2. Report phishing immediately.</h3>
<p>Phishing attacks are commonly carried out in mass, which means they are sent to a large number of people simultaneously. Usually, the approach focuses on individuals who are of the same status. If scammers make an effort to target your business, they will send out phishing attacks toward all employees, vendors, or clients of your company. Reporting the incident as soon as possible can help you avert future troubles.</p>
<p>Report phishing attacks to your organization's IT service desk or <strong>cybersecurity incident response policy (CIRP)</strong>. Quick reporting of the attack will allow the security team to begin collecting information about the problem.</p>

<h3>3. Investigate the phishing attack.</h3>
<p>When one reports a phishing attack, it's important to determine exactly how widespread and elaborate the attack is. IT experts should launch a first investigation into the incident as soon as it's announced. In addition to monitoring how many people were targeted, it's important to remove phishing emails from users' inboxes.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of attack, the repercussions of phishing can range from compromising the user's email account to the attacker gaining <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/u/unauacce.htm">unauthorized access</a> to the organization's network. Your IT team should further investigate affected users' computers, or associated networks, as there may be a risk that malicious programs could be installed on the user's device during the attack.</p>
<h3>4. Include the necessary regulatory authorities and law enforcement.</h3>
<p><em>Laws and standards mandate that companies have to report specific phishing attacks by a certain deadline once we discover them.</em></p>
<h3>5. Talk to your IT team about remediation strategies.</h3>
<p>Setting up a security procedure will help prevent different incidents from happening. iovation phishing security simulations are useful to make sure your employees are prepared for phishing attacks and can prevent them from breaching your systems.</p>
<p>Although email services, like Facebook, Gmail, and Apple Mail, will have basic security, it's not enough to entirely <a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/consumers-and-communities/consumer-protection/fraud-resources/phishing-attack-prevention.html">prevent the threat</a> from getting through. A single phishing attempt could cost you a great deal.</p>
<p>In summary, Phishing emails are the digital equivalent of getting a letter in the mail. Sure, the letters to you are unsolicited and often offer something you don't want, but they are still coming from someone you know and, in most cases, they're from a sender that you really trust. In 2022, it's still important that people stay vigilant about emails from people they know, especially from organizations or people they do business with. Keep those phishing emails away from your mailboxes where they belong!</p>
