		<p>An SMTP relay is a service that allows the transmission of email messages from one server to another. You can use an analogy for an SMTP relay service to picture an Olympic relay race: a transactional or promotional marketing email is the baton, and <strong>SMTP servers</strong> are runners who pass the baton to each other until the last relay line.</p>
<p>If you don't want to use an <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/smtp-as-a-service/smtp-relay">SMTP relay provider</a> to send emails, you may set up your own email server to ensure that the emails your staff members send a pass through or can be received. In such instances, you're accountable for setting up and maintaining your mail infrastructure, building a good email reputation, and dealing with email bounces and spam complaints.</p>
<p>There are a few different types of SMTP servers, but the most common is the SMTP relay server. SMTP relay servers are used to relay messages from one email server to another. In most cases, <em>SMTP relay servers are used to relay messages from an email client to an email server.</em></p>

<h2>5 Key Benefits Of Using An Smtp Relay Service</h2>
<p>When writing, several factors, such as the composition of the inbox, influence the effectiveness of sending a message:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Your SMTP email infrastructure</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Sender reputation</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The content of your messages</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You don't need to have extensive knowledge of email marketing to respond to numerous marketers who eschew trigger words in their emails and keep their copy typo-free, and our team isn't linking to questionable content or engaging in <strong>phishing scams</strong>, either.</p>
<ol>

<h3>1.&nbsp;SMTP relay providers become your sending infrastructure</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/ISP-Internet-service-provider">Internet service providers</a> examine your domain reputation in order to judge whether your email will be sent to the recipient's inbox or designated to the spam folder.</p>
<p><em>A great SMTP relay service keeps your business protected among a pool of high-reputability senders and ISPs with multiple options and resources.</em></p>
<p>If you administer your own SMTP mail server on a <strong>virtual machine</strong> (VM), you are out of luck controlling your reputation, which can lead to your IP address being blocked and leaving you only able to work your way back into your ISP's good graces.</p>
<ol>

<h3>2.&nbsp;SMTP relays let businesses send large volumes of emails</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ISPs and <strong>webmail providers </strong>often restrict the number of sent electronic emails to cut down on spam, even though those kinds of emails are created for the application, not user use, such as order confirmations. Your business may be restricted in its ability to nurture, engage, and support your customer, especially if it's a high-volume email sender.</p>
<ol>

<h3>3.&nbsp;SMTP relay services give you expert technical support</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Who doesn't want to work alongside the most talented? SMTP relay companies focus on providing top-notch email services, monitoring, and improving them. You gain access to a state-of-the-art mail infrastructure as well as an experienced support team that can assist you with any questions that you might have or <strong>deliverability challenges</strong>.</p>
<p>It differs significantly when you use your SMTP services only on your owner. You will need to know how to <a href="https://serversmtp.com/cannot-send-emails/">repair problems</a> when they arise, whether or not your server goes down in the middle of the night or legitimate email is suddenly bouncing.</p>
<ol>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="smtp-relay-service-2.jpg" alt="smtp-relay-service" /></p>

<h3>4.&nbsp;SMTP relay services clue you into deliverability issues and data insights</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One element we often hear from clients who switch to Postmark's SMTP relay service is that they couldn't receive a comprehensive understanding of their mail server's deliverability before the switch. <em>For instance, they couldn't find out just how many emails were bouncing or why it was happening.</em></p>
<p>In other words, SMTP services offer value far beyond the ability to hit send; they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK219874/">deliver vital data</a> and insights so that you can know whether your message has arrived or not, in which case you'll know why it failed.</p>
<ol>

<h3>5.&nbsp;SMTP relay services offer time-saving, user-friendly interfaces</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the email relay services that come with SMTP require very little setup, make user-friendliness a top priority, and surface and track information with as much ease as possible. Both staff members and executives can efficiently track down and surface valuable information about <strong>email communications</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you're scratching your head over a customer complaining that they didn't receive an order confirmation email. With a clean user interface, you'll find the email in question very quickly and view its bounce code in a clear, visual manner.</p>
<p>In summary, SMTP relay is a commonly misused term. SMTP relay is not the same as an open relay, neither of them should be used by a business because it will damage its reputation. If a business wants to send email outside their network they should use an authenticated SMTP server (MTA) to do so.</p>
