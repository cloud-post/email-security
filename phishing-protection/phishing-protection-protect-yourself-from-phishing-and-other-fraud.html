		<p>In the online world, nothing is more frustrating than being tricked into reconfiguring your email account and losing access to your important messages. It's frustrating enough when you're the one being tricked into changing your email settings, but it's downright infuriating when you realize someone else has been impersonating you and changing your email account's password. Luckily, there are various steps you can take to <a href="https://www.phishprotection.com">protect you from phishing</a> and other fraud.</p>
<p>Cyberattacks carried out by email are often referred to as phishing. Hackers design emails to attack the target and make them divulge personal information, or to trick them into downloading malware.

<p>Phishing email scams work by attempting to shock, threaten, or trick you into responding without thinking. Watch out for sentences with these or similar words.</p>

<p>Phishing scams might ask you to confirm personal information by responding to a request or going to a fake website that resembles a legitimate one. For instance, <em>a phisher may create a fake Gmail, Facebook, or University Web page to trick you into "logging into" your account with their real username and password.</em></p>
<p>Providing personal information in an incorrect response email or via a phony site jeopardizes your accounts as well as your identity. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/hacker">Hackers</a> might use your accounts to steal money or place an identity theft, and they can use your personal information to commit the crime.</p>

<li aria-level="1">If you are uncertain about the authenticity of an email you have received, attempt to reach the sender by phone or address.</li>

<li aria-level="1">Watch out for messages with a large number of errors, as they tend to be scams.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
