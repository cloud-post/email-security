		<p>Email marketing is one of the most effective and cost-efficient ways to promote your business. But how can you ensure that your emails get delivered? The answer, of course, is choosing the right <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/smtp-as-a-service">email sending service</a>. Fortunately, there are plenty of options available, each with its own specialties, strengths and weaknesses. Choosing one based on your needs and business structure should be an informed choice.</p>
<p>Email continues to be one of the most popular forms of communication in business today. In fact, it's estimated that over 89% of companies use email marketing as part of their overall marketing strategy. With so much riding on email marketing, it's important to find an email service provider (ESP) that can guarantee reliable, fast, and secure email delivery. To help you find the right ESP for your business email needs, we've compiled a list of three top email delivery services that you should consider:</p>
<h2>1. Pepipost - Most Affordable and Reliable Email Sending Service</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="pepipost.jpg" alt="pepipost" /></p>
<p>With over 20,000 customers worldwide, Pepipost is Asia's largest Email Delivery service. When it comes to deliverability, it's only ahead of Sendgrid, but with regard to speed it's no competition.</p>

<li aria-level="1">Pepipost <strong>provides a free Email Health Report</strong> that can help you discover your email health.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Pepipost provides Real-time reporting and notifications.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2. Sendgrid</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="sendgrid.jpg" alt="sendgrid" /></p>
<p>Sendgrid is one of the oldest <strong>Email Service Providers,</strong> and that allows them to be of service throughout the entire world. Their deliverability is quite good, which may appeal to businesses worldwide.</p>
<h2>3. Sparkpost</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="sparkpost.jpg" alt="sparkpost" /></p>
<p>Sparkpost have been the closest competition to <a href="https://sendgrid.com/why-sendgrid/">Sendgrid</a> for a long time, and they had <strong>excellent customer service</strong> with a trendy price tag as well. Before recently, Sparkpost management increased their pricing by 1.5 to 2 times per month, prompting many online solutions to observe them as either money monger or truly an operator of email delivery.</p>
<h2>4. Mailgun</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="mailgun.jpg" alt="mailgun" /></p>
<p><em>Mailgun enjoys delivering an Email Service for Developers through its efforts.</em></p>
<p>They have dedicated application programmer interfaces (APIs) for you to integrate the <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/what-is-an-smtp-server/">SMTP Server</a>, and they generously provide relevant analytics and detailed reports. The Email Verification utility was a crucial step in Mailgun's campaign to steadily boost email quality. In recent years we see that they have become increasingly concerned with their Bulk Emailing and Burst Sending campaigns because of the impression this leaves on their deliverability.</p>
<h2>5. Mandrill App</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="mandrill.jpg" alt="mandrill" /></p>
<p>Another notable Email Sending Service, Mandrill exists for quite a while. But once it was purchased by <a href="https://mailchimp.com/why-mailchimp/">Mailchimp</a>, it did not take long to see that users were concerned only about their marketing, and not the logistics of delivery.</p>
<p><em>Their excessive increase in pricing proves that they, too, have greatly changed.</em></p>
<p>Although it may well appear that Mailchimp really <strong>helps you with your email marketing</strong> (indeed, that is precisely what I have claimed in these words), if you really want to use Mandrill App in order to send out emails with regards to your concern, I would propose you reconsider your decision and consider your options more thoroughly.</p>
<p>In summary, if you are looking to send bulk email, the task can seem daunting. However, there are many email sending services to choose from, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. To make things a bit easier, we've compiled our top five email sending services.</p>
