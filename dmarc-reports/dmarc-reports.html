    			<p>If you&rsquo;re like most people, you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of a DMARC report. DMARC stands for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance, and it&rsquo;s a system that helps organizations to protect their email domains from spoofing and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/dmarc-report">DMARC report</a> is a report that is generated by DMARC-enabled email servers when they receive an email that fails DMARC authentication. The report includes information about the email, such as the sender, receiver, and date/time, as well as the reason why the email failed DMARC authentication.</p>
<p>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) not only protects your domain from BEC, domain impersonation, and email fraud attacks, it also enables you to view your inbound email programs, so you are never left in the dark what is happening in the background.</p>
<p>DAARC provides a status code report, in the form of DMARC documents, which allows domain owners to examine the status of sent email. This lets you report deliverability issues, take action against malicious senders, and take care of protocol implementation mistakes right away.</p>

<h2>How can visibility increase your client reach in 2022?</h2>
<p>When you have better insight into your email authentication data, it's easier for you to identify and eliminate errors in your electronic exchange system. On a frequent basis, when organizations extensively send emails in bulk, failing to configure <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-internet-security-protocols/">security protocols</a> often means that lots of these marketing and advertising emails get lost in transit.</p>
<p><em>This indicates that your firm is likely to miss out on a significant number of prospective customers who could see value in the products you've been producing.</em></p>
<p>Using DMARC reports to monitor your domains' performance is an effective way to ensure that you are quickly reaching your customers.</p>
<h2>Why Do You Need DMARC Reports?</h2>
<p>Let's explain the reason why you'll need DMARC reports to begin with. Irrespective of SPF and DKIM mechanisms, there is a particular risk that the original messages will be safely evaluated and processed, and the identity of the sender will remain unnoticed. <em>Receiving information about errors is also a common issue, though the services usually reform and improve.</em></p>
<p>DMARC steps in as an email authentication program that verifies that your email communication is authenticated by <a href="https://www.compassitc.com/blog/what-are-dkim-spf-and-dmarc">SPF or DKIM</a>. It guarantees that your emails are trusted and helps reduce the likelihood of inauthentic messages by permitting the recipient to check for valid headers before they even open the mail. You can ensure that your data is safe from cyberattacks by using extremely reliable and secure email security standards such as DMARC. DMARC is a robust standard that makes sure your addresses are accurate and protects them from phishing attacks, all while providing the highest possible email deliverability rates.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="dmarc-reports-077.jpg" alt="dmarc-reports" /></p>
<p>When you publish a DMARC record in your DNS, it lets you specify how your domain should respond to email when it fails to correctly authenticate and maintain the DKIM and SPF <strong>authentication systems</strong>. With a properly configured DMARC record, mailbox providers will send you report cards directly to your email address, HTML or HTTPS, letting you monitor the delivery of emails sent from your domain. By setting up DMARC reports, you can receive a great deal of valuable information about your outgoing mail traffic. You can use this information to authenticate your genuine sources and block your illegitimate ones.</p>
<h2>How to enable DMARC reporting for your domains?</h2>
<p>To configure the DMARC log for your domain, you must :</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Create a DMARC record for your domain</li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>In the &ldquo;rua&rdquo; criterion of your create record, enter the email address to which you want your aggregate reports to be sent out.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1">In the "ruf" criterion, you'll need to enter the email address to which you want the forensic reports to be sent.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Once you have fulfilled all of the other creds and pressed the Generate button, the AI will create a <strong>TXT record</strong> for you to post on your DNS server.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, DMARC can be an important asset to an organization and can help mitigate <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/email-spoofing">email spoofing</a>, phishing attacks, and other security issues. DMARC reports can be used to obtain an assessment of the implementation and effectiveness of DMARC. DMARC reports can also alert users to potentially missing SPF or DKIM records.</p>
