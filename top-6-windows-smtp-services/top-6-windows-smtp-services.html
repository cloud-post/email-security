                          <p>An SMTP service lets your system send email messages. We'll now consider the different kinds you can choose from. We'll then go on to present to you some examples of SMTP services, detailing their basic features to go with them so you can pick the best one for your requirements.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.duocircle.com/content/smtp-service/smtp-service-windows">SMTP service lets you send email messages</a>, and we'll now introduce you to the variety of them offered.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is an SMTP Server?</h2>
<p>A Simple Mail Transfer Protocol server uses proper authentication for sending emails over the Internet. It makes sure your emails are delivered to the proper recipient and aren't inadvertently marked junk. It is also designed so that your email messages do not land in the <strong>Junk folder</strong> of any of your users.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="smtp-services-14.jpg" alt="smtp-services" /></p>
<p>There are free and paid SMTP service providers. However, the free services <strong>limit</strong> how much email you can send.</p>
<p>Some, such as Google, do not permit transactional emails from business websites to be sent through WordPress websites. For that reason, it's worth paying a <strong>premium</strong> for a professional SMTP service rather than using free email providers to attempt to send this type of notification.</p>
<h2>Do we Need an SMTP Service?</h2>
<p>If you run a business website, strict <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-one-to-one-communication">one-to-one communication</a> along with your customers is important. In addition, you may need transactional email functionality to set up various triggers. These triggers can automatically send email invitations to users based on their activities. Therefore, you will need a SMTP service.</p>
<p>Many hosts offer SMTP servers to their customers. But that's not always the case. If you are unable to connect to an SMTP server through your hosting provider, you will often have to subcontract to a <strong>third-party company</strong> to handle this task instead.</p>
